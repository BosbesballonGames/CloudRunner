# CloudRunner

Endless Runner where you jump on procedurally generated clouds.
In [normal mode](https://github.com/BosbesballonGames/CloudRunner/tree/main#normal-mode) every ten (10) seconds the speed & gravity of the player get multiplied by 1.1 so that you slowly have to have better reaction time
